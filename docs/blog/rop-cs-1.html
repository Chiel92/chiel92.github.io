<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term <em>Railroad Oriented Programming</em> has been <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/" target="_blank">popularized by Scott Wlaschin as a term for a certain programming style for handling failure</a>.
In this article series we will look at how we can implement this style of programming in C#.
Let’s start by talking about the problems it is trying to solve.</p>

<p>Functions are often designed for the <strong>success path</strong>: the return type only consists of the type the function will return in case of a successful execution.
The following function definition likely wouldn’t stand out in an average code base.</p>

<p>This function is supposed to return a User object for the user with the username that is passed into the function.
But sometimes the function isn’t able to meet this expectation.</p>

<li>
<p>maybe the user doesn’t exist</p>

<p>If a function fails, usually one of the following things happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A default value is returned, such as a null reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An exception is thrown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A boolean or enum value is returned indicating success/failure cases while the actual result data is propagated through one or more <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier" target="_blank"><code>out</code> parameters</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_problems_with_using_default_values_for_failure"><a class="anchor" href="#_problems_with_using_default_values_for_failure"></a>Problems with using default values for failure</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <strong>value types</strong> the default value is a valid member of the value space of the type. So either there would be no way to distinguish between a success return value and a failure return value, or if there are special values reserved for failure signaling (like <code>-1</code> is often used in the case of <code>int</code>) there is no compile-time guarantee that the failure case is handled distinctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <strong>reference types</strong> the default value (<code>null</code>) is not a valid member of the value space of a class in the sense that you can’t call the class methods on it. The compiler however treats it as it <em>were</em> a valid member, leading to null-reference bugs. Since the addition of nonnullable reference types in C# 8.0 this set of problems has been diminished a great deal, but a non-negligible pool of pitfalls remains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no way to return any data along with the failure, such as an error message or some object indicating the reason or nature of the failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no way to distinguish between different kinds of failures.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the above paragraphs point out some problems with the respective failure-handling strategies, the main problem of these approaches is this: the <strong>failure path</strong> of <code>GetUser</code> is <strong>implicitly defined</strong>.
It is not part of the function signature, and the compiler is not aware of it.
As such, it doesn’t get the same amount of attention from the programmer as the success path and is quite frankly too often completely overlooked.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach is more explicit than the other two approaches.
However, the compiler is still unable to verify if the checks are done properly, if all cases are covered and if the right <code>out</code> parameters are used in the right cases.
If you restrict yourself to the Try-Parse Pattern this becomes less of a problem, but that disables distinghuising between different kinds of failures or returning data along with failures.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution sounds pretty obvious: make the failure path part of the normal return type of the function.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this idea sounds so trivial, why isn’t this done traditionally?
At least part of that has to do with the fact C-like languages do not make it easy to do this.
You would need to have a return type that can be <em>either</em> the success type <em>or</em> the failure type.
In functional programming languages such a construct <em>does</em> exist and is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union" target="_blank">Discriminated Union</a>.
But C-like languages, including C#, do not have support for such a type.
Luckily C# has had added lots of language features over the years that make it possible to emulate discriminated unions and use them in a relatively convenient and type-safe way.
In the <a href="/?page=rop-cs-2">next part</a> of this series we will have a look at one way of implementing explicit failure in C#: a <code>Result</code> type with two subtypes, the <code>Success</code> type for the success path and the <code>Failure</code> type for the failure path.</p>

<h3 id="_default_values_or_try_parse_vs_the_failure_type"><a class="anchor" href="#_default_values_or_try_parse_vs_the_failure_type"></a>Default values or Try-Parse vs the <code>Failure</code> type</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If performance is critical and you need to avoid as many allocations as possible, then using default values or the Try-Parse Pattern may be a good fit.
However, be aware of the pitfalls listed above.
If performance is not absolutely critical, neither of these solutions bear any advantages over a proper <code>Failure</code> type instance.
Moreover, using the <code>Result</code> type as your function return type makes the function calls composable, which makes your code more concise and type-safe, as we will see later on.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exception_throwing_vs_the_failure_type"><a class="anchor" href="#_exception_throwing_vs_the_failure_type"></a>Exception throwing vs the <code>Failure</code> type</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing a function, a good way for deciding whether to propagate a failure by throwing an exception is by asking the following question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Should the failure always cause the entire transaction to be aborted in any reasonably conceivable context in which the function might be called</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the answer is yes, then it is probably appropriate to handle the failure by throwing an exception.
If the answer is no, then it is probably better to handle the failure by incorporating it in the function return type, such that the caller is forced to make an explicit decision about how to handle the failure path.
